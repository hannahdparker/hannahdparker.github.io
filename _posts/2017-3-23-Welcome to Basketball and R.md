Welcome to Basketball and R! This site focuses on data analysis and
statistical procedures using basketball data. <!--more--> All the projects and
tutorials on this blog will be using the R programming language, but the
ideas behind many of the posts can be re-implemented with whatever you
feel comfortable with.

This blog will focus on tutorials and projects and will include step by
step R code. However, this isn't a basic R tutorial. The goal of a lot
of the tutorials I post will be learning stats and data analysis in an
NBA context. This might require a bit of background R knowledge for some
tutorials.

Another thing I want to stress is that I'll be learning some topics
along with you guys. There's a lot of different topics that I want to go
over, a lot of which I'm not an expert at yet. But I feel that learning
some of this stuff with something you're interested in (in this case,
basketball) can make things a lot easier. So feel free to ask any
questions or give any advice on blog posts.

With all this in mind, welcome again to Basketball and R!
