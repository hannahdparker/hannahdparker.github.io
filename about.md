Hey guys, thanks for checking out the site. My name is Jake. I'm a data scientist in New York City who's obsessed with basketball. I grew up in Indiana and am a die hard Pacers fan, so expect to see plenty of Pacers examples in my posts. Feel free to contact me with any questions or sage advice; I'm all ears!
