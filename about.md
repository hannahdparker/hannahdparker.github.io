My name is Jake Campbell. I'm currently a data modeling analyst at NYU. My background is in analytics and applied statistics. Basketball has always been my favorite sport and has been a great backdrop for me to help learn and better understand statistics. I hope the tutorials on the site can help you the same way they've helped me!
