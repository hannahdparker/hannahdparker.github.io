## This is a repository for the code and documentation I create as I gain a deeper understanding of probability and statistics and apply it to practical examples.

### For now, the content will live here https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1s-yLBN-lPxiL7wsUiT_rIfXIzvEiNJoc, and the code will live in the _lessons folder. Eventually the goal is to migrate this so it's compatible with a github.io blog format
